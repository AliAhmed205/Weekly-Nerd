        <h2>My Skills</h2>
        <p>Since the start of CMD, I've been practicing a lot with HTML/CSS. I hope to improve my JavaScript(ing) as
          well, so I can
          build more techincal sites, and perhaps even create real-time dynamic websites. I happen to code in my free
          time a lot
          since I enjoy creating. Before I started at CMD, I studied at Mediacollege, following the 'Mediavormger'
          coarse, which translates to "Graphic Designing".
          During it, I happened to use apps like Photoshop, Indesign and Illustrator. These are the same tools I use
          today so I can create content for my website,
          wether it be visuals or photoshopped images.

        <h2>My learning goals</h2>
        <h3>Critical Thinking and Systematic Approach</h3>
        <p>My first learning goal is to enhance my critical thinking abilities and approach tasks systematically. To
          achieve this, I will regularly reflect on my own thought processes and decision-making, challenging myself to
          delve deeper into the problems I encounter. I will effectively manage my time and tackle tasks incrementally,
          breaking them down into manageable steps and thoroughly analyzing each component before proceeding.
          Additionally, I will utilize planning tools and techniques such as mind mapping and checklists to structure
          and improve my thinking process.
          </p>
          <h3>Strengthening Collaboration Skills</h3>
          <p>My second learning goal is to strengthen my collaboration skills. To accomplish this, I will actively engage
          within the team, being open to others’ ideas and providing constructive feedback. I plan to hold regular
          check-ins with team members to discuss progress and identify any obstacles. Additionally, I will actively
          participate in team-building activities to strengthen relationships and promote effective collaboration.</p>

        <h3>Developing Skills with Tools and Technologies</h3>
        <p>My third learning goal is to develop proficiency with relevant tools and technologies essential for
        successfully completing the master’s project. I aim to achieve this through self-study and hands-on practice
        with project-specific tools. I will also leverage the knowledge and expertise of more experienced team members
        in this area. Furthermore, I will participate in workshops and training sessions to refine my technical skills
        and stay updated with the latest developments in my field.</p>

        <h2>💡 Reflection</h2>
        <p>I am aware that Miriam also held her talk, but it wasn't necessarily interesting to me even though I'm
          certain that the info she shared was definitely of great value. I really favored Bramus' talk more since I
          adore view transitions, making the web seem so fluid and unique. Once View transitions are available for
          cross-browser use,
          I will definitely use it in my own websites.
