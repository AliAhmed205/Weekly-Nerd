        <h2>About</h2>
        <h3>FutureLab at De Waag is dedicated to exploring the ethical and societal implications of emerging
          technologies. Their mission is to encourage critical reflection on technology, challenge cultural assumptions,
          and explore alternatives rooted in public values. This isnâ€™t just about innovation for its own sake; itâ€™s
          about co-developing technology with society to pave the way for a more open, fair, and inclusive future.
        </h3>

        <h2>Foundation</h2>
        <p>They emphasize viewing technology from the citizenâ€™s perspective, categorizing this viewpoint into layers
          akin to a mobile phone ecosystem. A mobile phone is not just a device but a complex stack comprising content,
          services, apps, software libraries, exchange protocols, app stores, firmware, operating systems, hardware, and
          cloud servers. Each layer interacts to shape our technological interactions profoundly.
        </p>
        <p>Deconstructing technology into foundational layers, FutureLab highlights four fundamental aspects: the
          foundational context of technology development, the openness of the design process, the technical stack that
          supports the ecosystem, and a citizen-centric approach. Understanding these layers is crucial for recognizing
          biases, intentions, and societal impacts embedded in technology.

        <h2>Workshop</h2>
        <p>Waag held a workshop during their visit and focused on exploring social
          values. Participants engaged in an exercise where they positioned themselves within one of four designated
          boxes on the floor, each corresponding to different responses to a series of questions. These questions
          touched on topics such as smartphone preference (Apple, Android, other), past switches between phone
          brands/systems, and considerations about privacy, data, and personal values.</p>

        <p>Following this interactive exercise, participants worked in groups to fill out a form detailing their
          personal
          values regarding smartphones, reflecting on which values were currently met and which were not. Subsequently,
          participants embarked on a creative session to construct their ideal phone based on these values, using
          abstract hexagonal images as a design medium. Many designs prioritized safety as a central theme, reflecting
          participantsâ€™ collective aspirations for secure and value-aligned smartphone experiences.</p>

        <h2>ðŸ’¡ Reflection</h2>
        <p>the workshop underscored the importance of critically examining the impact of technology on our lives and
          society. It emphasized the need for technology to be aligned with broader societal values, ensuring that
          innovation serves to enhance our lives in meaningful and ethical ways. This experience has encouraged me to be
          more mindful of the choices I make regarding technology, striving for a balance that respects both personal
          preferences and societal well-being.</p>
