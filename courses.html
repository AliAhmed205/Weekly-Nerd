          <h3>Web-apps from scratch</h3>
        </a>
        <p>The first course of the minor was a good refresher for me. Before the minor began, I was already familiar
          with
          HTML/CSS and some JavaScript. With the help of Marten and Bas, I learned more about JSON and fetching data via
          APIs. During my self-study of JavaScript, I focused on practicing writing functions and adjusting CSS. Both
          the
          individual and group assignments went well.</p>

          <h3>CSS 2 the Rescue</h3>
        </a>
        <img class="code" src="./images/css-to-the-rescue.png" alt="CSS to the Rescue">
        <p>So far, I've learned a lot from CSS 2 the Rescue. Thanks to the weekly workshops by Sanne, Nils, and Roel, I
          could code various interesting things. I especially want to thank Sanne, who even helped me late into the
          evening with my assignment, sometimes until 5:00 or 6:00 pm. The discovery of <code>:has()</code> was truly
          enlightening for me. I never thought CSS calculations could be so useful. I learned about <b>calc</b>, as well
          as <b>lvh, dvh, rem, em, vw, and vh</b>. Additionally, I learned a lot about efficiently using variables by
          setting certain values beforehand and using them later. At one point, Sanne and I made values so flexible that
          assigning them felt almost like assigning a simple number, after which everything fit perfectly. Overall, I
          found this to be a fantastic course from which I gained a lot.</p>

          <h3>Browser Technologies</h3>

        <img class="code" src="./images/browser-tech.png" alt="Browser Tech">
        <p>Peter Paul Koch, better known as PPK, imparted a lot of theoretical knowledge about browsers and the rules
          associated with them. Although unlike CSS 2 the Rescue, we did fewer practical exercises, this course greatly
          enhanced my independence. I started searching more on the internet and looked for ways to implement the
          functionalities I desired. Here, I also got acquainted with <b>localStorage</b>, which I honestly had never
          heard of before. It's a handy local database where I could store my form data. I also found validation
          interesting, and thanks to the :has() method, I could mimic certain JavaScript validations. I especially kept
          in
          mind that the site had to remain functional to a certain extent. The assessment went well, and I am satisfied
          with both my grade and the outcome.</p>

          <h3>Hackaton</h3>

        <img class="code" src="./hackathon-3.png" alt="Hackahton">
        <p>During the CSS Day - 10th Edition hackathon, our team created an interactive website featuring a unique “CSS
          Slotmachine” for data exploration. I focused on styling and user interaction, using each year’s color theme
          consistently. Collaborating with Kevin, Bart, and Tristan, we faced some challenges but maintained effective
          communication. I gained insights into database integration and honed my JavaScript skills for dynamic class
          management. Despite initial concept challenges, I valued contributing professionally and supporting team
          cohesion during presentations.</p>

          <h3>API</h3>
        </a>
        <p>I think this might have been the most enjoyable course we had. I found the API very fascinating, especially
          what Cyd and Declan showed me regarding routing and functionalities. It took some puzzling, but I eventually
          achieved the desired result. It was nice to work with Node.js again, as I found it very captivating last year
          as
          well. Dynamic websites generating content from a database appeal to me. Although I had some knowledge from
          last
          year, Declan's short tutorial at the beginning of the minor helped me get back on track. This time, I wanted
          to
          approach it differently, especially visually. I opted for the streaming service web app and felt that the
          studios deserved more representation. Therefore, I created a unique style for each studio and ensured that
          only
          Disney films, for example, appeared on the Disney page, and Sony films on the Sony page, etc. Overall, I
          appreciated the freedom we were given, and I finished the course with a perfect score! A shoutout to Declan
          and
          Cyd, who really helped me exceptionally well and gave me valuable tips.</p>

          <h3>Human Centered Design</h3>
        </a>
        <p>This course certainly made me aware of something important. I discovered a new world of possibilities often
          overlooked by large companies managing websites with a large number of daily users. My experience with Petra,
          who is blind, and building for her was truly unique. I felt honored to offer her a new option in her life with
          mobile use. She also shared her own experiences with existing apps and how she navigated using her iPhone. It
          was a challenging process, but Petra was very pleased with the result, as were Eric, Tamara, and Vasilis.
          Their
          enthusiasm and weekly presentations expanded my understanding of the world of accessibility and emphasized its
          importance. It showed me that it doesn't always have to be boring and that there is occasional room for
          levity,
          because these special users are still people. This course ensured that I will apply inclusive design where
          necessary.</p>
