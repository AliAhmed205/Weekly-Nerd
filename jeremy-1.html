        <h2>About</h2>
        <h3>In this Weekly Nerd session, we welcomed Jeremy Keith, where the discussion focused on the contrast between
          declarative and imperative programming. Keith, a prominent figure in the web development community, brought
          his deep knowledge and insights, exploring how these concepts relate to programming languages.

        <h2>Jeremy Keith's poetry</h2>
        <p>Jeremy Keith's Weekly Nerd session offered a fascinating exploration of the parallels between music
          composition and programming languages, specifically contrasting the approaches of classical and jazz music
          with imperative and declarative programming.</p>
        <p>By drawing a difference between classical and jazz music, Keith highlighted the contrasting methodologies
          applied in music composition. Classical music, with its detailed sheet music and precise instructions,
          represents the imperative approach, where every note and instruction is explicitly defined. In contrast, jazz
          music embraces a more "imperative" and "declarative" approach, characterized by key intervals and
          improvisation within an established framework.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="speaker-insights">
        <p>Keith translated this comparison to programming languages, discussing the difference between imperative and
          declarative programming. Imperative programming, similar to classical music, involves telling the computer
          exactly what to do, while declarative programming, like jazz music, allows more flexibility and
          self-expression, where the programmer specifies the desired outcome and the computer responds accordingly.</p>
        <img class="code" src="./Sprekers/Week 5/statements_vs_expressions.png" alt="imperative-and-declarative">

        <p>Keith illustrated this concept with examples from web development languages such as HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript. HTML and CSS, as declarative languages, provide structure and styling without explicit
          instructions for every action. JavaScript, on the other hand, follows an imperative approach, allowing more
          direct control over functionality and behavior.</p>

      </section>
      <section class="speaker-insights">
        <p>A notable example discussed by Keith was the creation of a button component. While HTML offers a simple
          declarative approach by allowing developers to create a button tag, some programmers opt for a more imperative
          approach by coding their own button functionality in JavaScript. This need for control, Keith explained, can
          lead to bugs but also reflects a preference for hands-on management over delegation to the browser.</p>
        <p>Regarding CSS, Keith delved into the nuances of specifying styles and the shift towards more responsive and
          flexible design approaches. He highlighted techniques such as <b>`clamp`</b>, <b>`calc`</b>, and
          <b>`fit-content`</b> as examples of how designers collaborate with machines to create adaptable layouts that
          respond to user preferences.</p>

        <p>Understanding this system is essential for efficient product development. Individual
          thinking patterns, such as analytical versus systems thinking, also influence the choice between imperative
          and declarative methodologies. An example of this can be seen in design systems, where defining color codes
          shows a difference between imperative control and declarative flexibility. Whether declarative design systems
          are better than imperative ones depends on project needs, team preferences, and product nature. A balance
          between both approaches is often the most effective.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="speaker-insights">
        <p>At the end, Keith emphasized the importance of finding a balance between control and flexibility, whether in
          music composition, programming languages, or design systems. While imperative approaches offer granular
          control, declarative approaches promote adaptability and collaboration between humans and machines. As the web
          evolves, Keith suggests that letting go of some control can ultimately lead to more effective and harmonious
          design experiences.</p>

        <h2>ðŸ’¡ Reflection</h2>
        <p>After exploring Jeremy Keith's insights on declarative and imperative programming during the Weekly Nerd
          session, I was certainly impressed. His ability to explain complex concepts in an accessible way and connect
          them to different disciplines is inspiring. This reflection has made me think about my own approach to web
          development and how I can benefit from both declarative and imperative methodologies. I appreciate the
          perspective that Keith has provided and look forward to applying these insights in my own work.</p>
