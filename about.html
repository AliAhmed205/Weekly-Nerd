        <h2>My Skills</h2>
        <p>Since the start of CMD, I've been practicing a lot with HTML/CSS. I hope to improve my JavaScript(ing) as
          well, so I can build more techincal sites, and perhaps even create real-time dynamic websites. I happen to code in my free
          time a lot since I enjoy creating. </p>
          <img class="gd" src="./images/graphic-design.png" alt="Graphic Design Icons">
          <p>Before I started at CMD, I studied at Mediacollege, following the 'Mediavormger'
          coarse, which translates to "Graphic Designing".
          During it, I happened to use apps like Photoshop, Indesign and Illustrator. These are the same tools I use
          today so I can create content for my website,
          wether it be visuals or photoshopped images.

        <h2>My learning goals</h2>
        <h3>Critical Thinking and Systematic Approach</h3>
        <p>My first learning goal is to enhance my critical thinking abilities and approach tasks systematically. To
          achieve this, I will regularly reflect on my own thought processes and decision-making, challenging myself to
          delve deeper into the problems I encounter.</p>

        <h3>Strengthening Collaboration Skills</h3>
        <p>My second learning goal is to strengthen my collaboration skills. To accomplish this, I will actively engage
          within the team, being open to othersâ€™ ideas and providing constructive feedback. </p>
          <img class="gif" src="https://media.tenor.com/6ph1w40DrykAAAAi/handshake-joypixels.gif" alt="shaking hands gif">
          <p>I plan to hold regular
          check-ins with team members to discuss progress and identify any obstacles. Additionally, I will actively
          participate in team-building activities to strengthen relationships and promote effective collaboration.</p>

        <h2 class="blank">blank space</h2>
        <h3>Developing Skills with Tools and Technologies</h3>
        <p>My third learning goal is to develop proficiency with relevant tools and technologies essential for
          successfully completing the masterâ€™s project. I aim to achieve this through self-study and hands-on practice
          with project-specific tools.</p>
          <p>I will also leverage the knowledge and expertise of more experienced team members
          in this area. Furthermore, I will participate in workshops and training sessions to refine my technical skills
          and stay updated with the latest developments in my field.</p>

        <h2>ðŸ’¡ Final Minor Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          I have reached the end of the minor, and I know Iâ€™ll miss it deeply. It wasnâ€™t just the courses, but also the
          incredible people I was surrounded by. We all learned from each other and had a great time, even during the
          most stressful moments. The workshops were incredibly insightful, and the weekly talks from experts often
          provided enlightening perspectives.</p>

         <p> I would highly recommend this minor to any second-year student who wants to enhance their coding skills and
          work on exciting projects. My teachers have certainly noticed my growth, even as I continue to progress. They
          consistently encouraged me to strive for excellence and to find best practices in everything I create.</p>

          <p>Overall, I had an amazing experience. Iâ€™ve achieved many of my existing goals and set new ones, inspired by
          some of the speakers. Iâ€™m excited about my future as a professional front-end developer!</p>
