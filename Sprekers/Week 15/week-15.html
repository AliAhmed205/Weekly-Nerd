        <h2>üí° Reflection</h2>
        <p>Q42 gave me a very good impression and seemed like a company where one can definitely develop their skill, as
          well as working on great diverse projects. Which can vary to unique map visualization to societal problems and
          difficulties. Q42 is a great space for interns who wish to become flexible in their workflow and learn so much
          from both the company as its identity.
