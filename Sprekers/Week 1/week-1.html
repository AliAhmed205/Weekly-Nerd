          <h2>What is Polypane?</h2>
          <p>Polypane allows users to create and test responsive websites by providing the ability to view the site
            simultaneously on different screen sizes and devices. This is especially useful for optimizing the user
            experience across various devices, such as desktops, tablets, and smartphones.</p>
          <p>One of the unique features of
            Polypane is its built-in support for various web technologies and standards, making it easy for developers to
            work with modern tools and frameworks. Additionally, it offers powerful tools for analyzing performance and
            accessibility, enabling developers to improve the quality of their websites.</p>

          <p>One of the key points that Valkhof emphasizes is that browser makers are listening to the needs of developers
            and implementing functionalities that previously had to be built manually. Modern browsers can now perform
            many
            tasks that were previously attributed to JavaScript, but faster and more accessibly.</p>
          <p>Valkhof highlights the importance of reusing code and reducing research time for web developers. He
            encourages
            developers to first check if there is already a built-in solution available when building new functionalities,
            instead of relying on JavaScript.

          <h2>The Rule of Least Power</h2>
          <p>In his argument, Valkhof emphasizes the importance of applying the basic principle of "the rule of least
            power" when building web technologies. This principle advises choosing the least powerful language suitable
            for a particular purpose. He argues that JavaScript, although powerful, is also vulnerable and delicate. By
            writing clear HTML, many functionalities can be achieved without the need for JavaScript.</p>

          <h2>In-page Transitions</h2>
          <p>In-page transitions can be used to create smooth transitions when a user scrolls through a page. This can be
            achieved using the `scroll-behavior` CSS property. As a result, the page scrolls smoothly to the desired
            position, providing an improved user experience without needing JavaScript.</p>

          <h2>ðŸ’¡ Reflection</h2>
          <p>Personally, I am glad that we are becoming less dependent on JavaScript. Not that I don't appreciate
            JavaScript, but logic is not my strong suit. The rise of selectors like selectlist and custom toggles makes it
            much easier for me as a designer to keep track of the available functionalities. I certainly plan to make use
            of this.
            However, I still find it important to master JavaScript. In my opinion, it is still more powerful than CSS and
            offers additional functionality.</p>
