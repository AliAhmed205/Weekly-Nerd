        <h2>About</h2>
        <h3>During this Weekly Nerd session, we had Rosa Schuurman as a guest speaker. Rosa is known for her skills in
          UX design, React development, and her passion for 'creative coding'. She is a true pioneer in applying circuit
          bending, creatively adapting existing technologies and frameworks to create unique and innovative projects.

        <h2>Circuit Bending</h2>
        <img  src="./circuitbending.jpg" alt="bending">
        <p>Rosa's expertise in circuit bending goes beyond just manipulating electronic devices. She uses this technique
          to discover and create new sounds, and has even contributed to projects such as sound design for ToysR'Us
          Studios. Her involvement in the circuit bending process illustrates her inventiveness and her ability to
          transform conventional technologies into something entirely new. By manipulating existing sound systems, Rosa
          uncovers new possibilities and brings fresh, creative perspectives to the forefront.</p>

      <article class="speaker">
        <h2>Alternative Game Development</h2>
        <p>In addition to her work in UX design and circuit bending, Rosa prefers alternative approaches to game
          development. Instead of traditional platforms like Unity, she opts for Gamemaker Studio, offering an
          alternative approach to game development. This choice reflects her creative spirit and willingness to think
          outside the box. By experimenting with different tools and frameworks, Rosa explores new possibilities and
          encourages others to embrace their own unique approaches.</p>

      <article class="speaker">
        <h2>Music Creation</h2>
        <p>Rosa's creative talent also extends to music creation, where she uses PureData, a visual programming language
          designed for interactive computer music and multimedia works. Her passion for music and technology converges
          in these creative expressions, resulting in unique and engaging compositions. By combining her UX design
          skills with her love for music, Rosa creates a seamless integration of technology and creativity that
          distinguishes and inspires her work.</p>
          <h2>Career Advice</h2>
          <p>During the session, Rosa shared valuable career advice, emphasizing the importance of surrounding oneself
            with inspiring people for professional growth. She advised interns to choose companies that align with their
            values and interests, and stressed the importance of developing hard skills to stand out in the job market.</p>

        <h2>ðŸ’¡ Reflection</h2>
        <p>Exploring Rosa's work and her approach to technology has inspired me to think outside the box and embrace
          creativity in my own work. Her ability to redefine conventional technologies and her career development advice
          have broadened my perspective and encouraged me to chart my own unique path in the world of design and
          technology. Rosa's contribution to the Weekly Nerd session has not only expanded my knowledge but has also
          inspired me to explore new possibilities and push my creative boundaries.</p>
