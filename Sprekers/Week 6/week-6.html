        <h2>Julia's amazing talent</h2>
        <p>Julia crafts stunning visuals and animations with over a thousand lines of CSS. When she first stepped into
          the classroom, I couldn‚Äôt have anticipated the incredible work she was about to present. Although she didn‚Äôt
          delve deeply into her code, she explained that specific factors are essential to achieve the movement of
          certain elements.</p>

        <p>This CSS code creates a visually centered layout with intricate animations and detailed elements. It defines
          a ‚Äúforest‚Äù scene featuring trees, monsters, a ghost, and moss, each with specific dimensions, positions, and
          colors. Animations like ‚Äúmonster1‚Äù and ‚ÄúforestGhost‚Äù bring these elements to life, rotating and moving them
          infinitely. Additionally, a ‚Äúhouse‚Äù and ‚Äúshelf‚Äù are styled with walls, windows, and various decorative items
          such as staff, dust particles, and herbs, all meticulously positioned and animated to enhance the overall
          visual complexity.</p>

        <h2>üí° Reflection</h2>
        <p>While I definitely adore her amazing CSS animations, it's as far as that goes, just animations.
          I can't imagine the days, weeks or even months she goes through to make these, which definitely 
          makes me respect her alot.</p>
