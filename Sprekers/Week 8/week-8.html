        <h2>About</h2>
        <h3>During this Weekly Nerd session, Marieke, a researcher in digital accessibility, and Pim, co-founder of
          Digitaal Toegankelijk, were invited to speak. This session offered an in-depth exploration of digital
          accessibility, highlighting essential concepts and practical tips to make digital products accessible for
          everyone.

        <h2>For everyone</h2>
        <p>Marieke, a former student who interned at Active Collective, and Pim began their session with some icebreaker
          questions that emphasized the core of digital accessibility. They explored who likes to be excluded and who
          one prefers to exclude, paying attention to both temporary and permanent disabilities. This revealed that the
          design of digital products can make a significant difference for people with disabilities.</p>

        <h2>WCAG, The Big Four, Low Hanging Fruit, and P.O.U.R</h2>
        <p>During the presentation, emphasis was placed on the <b>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</b> and
          its four core principles:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span>Perceivable</span></li>
          <li><span>Operable</span></li>
          <li><span>Understandable</span></li>
          <li><span>Robust</span></li>
        </ul>

      <article class="speaker">
        <img src="./POUR-800x420.png" alt="disabled-3">
        <p>These principles guide the creation of accessible digital content. Perceivable focuses on ensuring all
          information is perceivable, Operable on guaranteeing usability, Understandable on making content
          comprehensible, and Robust on creating robust and compatible content. Specific criteria, such as the need for
          audio control and avoiding flashing elements, were highlighted as crucial for digital accessibility. This
          explanation provided a deep understanding of the complexity of digital accessibility and the need to consider
          diverse user needs and capabilities when designing and developing digital content.</p>

        <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
        <p>The speakers emphasized the importance of listening to digital products with a screen reader and navigating
          using only a keyboard to understand and improve the user experience for people with various disabilities. They
          also encouraged testing with the target audience to uncover and resolve any accessibility issues.</p>

        <h2>ðŸ’¡ Reflection</h2>
        <p>Exploring digital accessibility during this session has increased my awareness of the importance of
          inclusive design in the digital world. Understanding the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and its
          four core principles made me realize that accessibility is not just an afterthought but an integral part of
          the design and development process. Realizing that small details, such as audio control and avoiding
          flashing elements, can have a significant impact on the user experience for people with various disabilities
          has made me see how crucial it is to make inclusive design decisions. I am determined to integrate these
          insights into my work and actively strive to create digital products that are accessible to everyone.</p>
