        <p>In addition to the wrapper element, Nils also discussed the optional column technique, a grid-based layout
          concept he enjoys using. By defining columns with the "fr" unit, he can create a flexible layout that adapts
          to different screen sizes. This allows him to optimize the layout of his websites and highlight key content
          while considering responsiveness and user experience.</p>

      <article class="speaker reflection">
        <h2>ðŸ’¡ Reflection</h2>
        <p>I found the discussion on various units in web development very engaging and valuable. Understanding units
          like pixels, percentages, and viewport width/height provides a deeper insight into managing and optimizing
          website layouts. The key aspect I highlighted is website responsiveness. A grid-based layout makes it easier
          to create a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience.
          Furthermore, using a grid-based layout provides a structured approach to organizing content, enhances
          efficiency in the design process, and ensures consistent and attractive layouts on all devices. Mastering and
          applying a grid-based layout is essential for modern web developers to create responsive and well-structured
          websites.</p>
