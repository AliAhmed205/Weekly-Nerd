        <h2>About</h2>
        <h3>During the second "Weekly Nerd" session, we welcomed Fenna de Wilde, an exceptionally talented front-end
          developer who describes herself as "creative." She emphasizes this because she is often involved in the design
          process and can share her expertise on how the final design can come together.</h3>
        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
        <p>Fenna graduated from the Hogeschool van Amsterdam and completed her internship at <b>Build in Amsterdam</b>.
          During her presentation, she shared some valuable insights, which are often covered in our curriculum but can
          be overlooked in practice: accessibility within websites.</p>
        <p>During Fenna's presentation, she emphasized the importance of making websites and apps accessible to
          everyone, not just those without disabilities. She provided useful tips, such as using focus states, where
          there are two variants to apply the focus state: :focus & :focus-visible. The main difference here is that
          ":focus-visible" targets specific elements selected with the keyboard rather than the mouse or touch.</p>

        <h2 class="blank">Blankspace</h2>
        <p>Another important aspect Fenna addressed was the use and addition of Aria attributes to enhance accessibility
          for users who use screen readers. There are numerous possibilities with these attributes to clearly
          communicate to a screen reader what happens with certain elements. I personally found aria-controls
          interesting. Aria-controls is used to link a control element to the element it controls. This allows screen
          readers to understand the connection and provide more context to users. For example, a button, link, or tab.
          And refer to the ID of the element it manages. For example, dropdown. A brief summary of the treated Aria
          attributes follows below:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><span>Focus state for keyboard users</span></li>
          <li><span>Aria attributes</span></li>
          <li><span>Accessible carousels</span></li>
          <li><span>Focus protection</span></li>
          <li><span>Semantics</span></li>
          <li><span>Color contrast</span></li>
          <li><span>Text size</span></li>
          <li><span>Line height</span></li>
          <li><span>Alternative text description</span></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>ðŸ’¡ Reflection</h2>
        <p>It's amazing to see how Fenna de Wilde shares her expertise and emphasizes the importance of accessibility
          within websites. Her presentation offers valuable insights that are relevant not only to beginners but also to
          experienced developers. Her clear explanation of topics such as focus states and Aria attributes clearly
          underscores the importance of accessible design.</p>
        <p>What I particularly appreciate is how Fenna provides practical tips that can be immediately applied in
          practice. Her emphasis on involving people with different abilities in the development process underscores the
          importance of inclusivity and empathy in the field of front-end development. Overall, I found Fenna's
          presentation very informative and inspiring.</p>
