        <h2>About</h2>
        <h3>With over 20 years of experience in building websites, a role in the Electron Governance Team, and creating
          a browser for Polypane, Kilian Valkhof has a wealth of knowledge in web development. His insights are valuable
          for anyone involved in creating digital experiences.</h3>

        <h2>What is Polypane?</h2>
        <p>Polypane allows users to create and test responsive websites by providing the ability to view the site
          simultaneously on different screen sizes and devices. This is especially useful for optimizing the user
          experience across various devices, such as desktops, tablets, and smartphones.</p>
        <p>One of the unique features of
          Polypane is its built-in support for various web technologies and standards, making it easy for developers to
          work with modern tools and frameworks. Additionally, it offers powerful tools for analyzing performance and
          accessibility, enabling developers to improve the quality of their websites.</p>

        <h2 class="blank">What is Polypane?</h2>
        <p>One of the key points that Valkhof emphasizes is that browser makers are listening to the needs of developers
          and implementing functionalities that previously had to be built manually. Modern browsers can now perform
          many
          tasks that were previously attributed to JavaScript, but faster and more accessibly.</p>

        <p>Valkhof highlights the importance of reusing code and reducing research time for web developers. He
          encourages
          developers to first check if there is already a built-in solution available when building new functionalities,
          instead of relying on JavaScript.

        <h2>The Rule of Least Power</h2>
        <p>In his argument, Valkhof emphasizes the importance of applying the basic principle of "the rule of least
          power" when building web technologies. This principle advises choosing the least powerful language suitable
          for a particular purpose. He argues that JavaScript, although powerful, is also vulnerable and delicate. By
          writing clear HTML, many functionalities can be achieved without the need for JavaScript.</p>
        <h2>Browser Makers Listen and Implement</h2>
        <p>One of the key points that Valkhof emphasizes is that browser makers are listening to the needs of developers
          and implementing functionalities that previously had to be built manually. Modern browsers can now perform
          many tasks that were previously attributed to JavaScript, but faster and more accessibly.</p>

        <h2>Efficient Code Reuse</h2>
        <p>Valkhof highlights the importance of reusing code and reducing research time for web developers. He
          encourages developers to first check if there is already a built-in solution available when building new
          functionalities, instead of relying on JavaScript.</p>
        </p>
        <h2>Custom Toggles (Switches)</h2>
        <img class="code" src="./content/custom-toggles.png" alt="Custom Toggles">
        <p>One example that Valkhof cites is the use of custom toggles, also known as switches. Previously, these were
          often implemented with JavaScript, but now they can be efficiently created using pure HTML and CSS. By using
          the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements and CSS styles, the toggle switch can be styled and adjusted to
          user interaction.</p>

      <section class="speaker-insights">
        <h2>In-page Transitions</h2>
        <p>In-page transitions can be used to create smooth transitions when a user scrolls through a page. This can be
          achieved using the `scroll-behavior` CSS property. As a result, the page scrolls smoothly to the desired
          position, providing an improved user experience without needing JavaScript.</p>

      <section class="speakers-reflection">
        <h2>ðŸ’¡ Reflection</h2>
        <p>Personally, I am glad that we are becoming less dependent on JavaScript. Not that I don't appreciate
          JavaScript, but logic is not my strong suit. The rise of selectors like selectlist and custom toggles makes it
          much easier for me as a designer to keep track of the available functionalities. I certainly plan to make use
          of this.
          However, I still find it important to master JavaScript. In my opinion, it is still more powerful than CSS and
          offers additional functionality.</p>
