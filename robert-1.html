        <h2>There are five points to consider when looking for a new job:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The Landscape:</strong> Stay informed about changes in the work field such as inflation, job
            roles, flexibility, and culture. Understand what is fundamental and maintain curiosity and enjoyment.</li>

          <li><strong>The Type of Employer:</strong> Consider options like freelancing, traineeships, detachment,
            full-service agencies, and in-house services, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.</li>

          <li><strong>The Stack:</strong> Know which programming languages are favored by companies. Choosing a stack
            wisely, especially for freelancers, is beneficial; mastering foundational skills enables learning across
            different technologies.</li>

          <li><strong>Money vs Benefits:</strong> Discuss desired earnings and benefits, understanding gross and net
            income and tax implications. Personal preferences and circumstances influence what constitutes fair
            compensation. Consider additional perks like holiday allowances, pensions, development budgets, bonuses, and
            more.</li>

          <li><strong>The Vibe:</strong> Evaluate the company's atmosphere and culture. Enjoying your job, having
            workplace freedoms, and choosing projects are crucial. However, these shouldn't compensate for inadequate
            salary or benefits.</li>
        </ul>
