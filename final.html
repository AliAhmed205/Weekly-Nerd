        <h2>About</h2>
        <h3>Design and develop a website to showcase art in Castricum, featuring both permanent installations (with help
          from Stichting Oud-Castricumâ€™s inventory) and past temporary exhibits like Jimmy Nelsonâ€™s beach and dune
          photos and Wheeping Elephant on the beach plateau.</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>The design should be easily adaptable, potentially for
          platforms like Wordpress, with integration capabilities we cannot manage ourselves. A preliminary design by
          Ruben emphasizes artistic presentation aligned with the works, inspired by Volkskrant Story. The site should
          facilitate communication with stakeholders via linked email addresses.
          <br>
          <br>
          Weâ€™ve secured the domain name kunstinc.nl. Integration of fundraising efforts and a social media
          implementation plan are also desired.

        <h2>Thoughts on the project</h2>
        <p>This was certainly the most challenging project I have ever worked on, not to mention my first official
          website developed alongside my teammates. I thoroughly enjoyed developing my node.JS (EJS) coding skills,
          especially in handling dynamic values.</p>

        <p>Despite not actually fetching anything in our local workspace,
          integrating with PHP in WordPress posed a significant challenge. I never anticipated the amount of work
          involved in setting everything up.</p>
        <p>We managed to create a custom CMS area for Femke, our project assigner,
          within WordPress. Overall, I am very proud of my accomplishments, which I will discuss further in the
          following paragraphs.</p>

        <h2>SVG-logo Animation</h2>
        <img class="code" src="./images/logo-hover.gif" alt="Animation-hover">
        <p>I took great pride in animating the Kunst in C logo SVG. Through CSS, I manipulated its paths and groups to
          achieve a smooth transition when users hovered over it. Additionally, I implemented a transformation with an
          added BEM class, which activated when users scrolled past the starting point, simultaneously triggering the
          appearance of the navigation bar.

        <h2>Map Animation</h2>
        <p>Another achievement Iâ€™m proud of is the interactive visual map of Castricum. When a user interacts with it,
          the websiteâ€™s name is replaced with the regionâ€™s name. Additional icons appear on top of the selected region,
          while other interactive regions disappear, ensuring full user focus on the map section.

        <h2>ðŸ’¡ Reflection</h2>
        <p>I learned more than I expected to do during this project. I did set a few goals but I learned much more than
          I anticipated. Furthermore, I got inspired to use WordPress with PHP to create my own themes and such. I know
          that the project is over, but I wouldn't mind doing a few things from the bottom of my coding-eagerness. I'm
          glad I reached new heights and interests during this final assigment.</p>
